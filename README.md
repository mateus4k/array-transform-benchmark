# Array Transform Benchmark

Test case: remove the `content` property from all items in the array

## Scenario

- 50 arrays of objects
- Object structure:

```json
{
  "filename": "[number]-filename",
  "content": "[17Mb file]"
}
```

## Environment:

- node:8.4.0-alpine
- mem_limit: 256m
- mem_reservation: 124M
- cpus: 1

## Result

Fastest is _for + push_ ðŸŽ‰
